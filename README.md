## 公式问题

### 公式与上下文不衔接

The equations should be consistent with the context. In other words, each equation should be regarded as a part of the sentence. The punctuation mark at the end of the last statement before the equation should connect the statement and the equation smoothly, if there is. The punctuation mark at the end of the equation should correctly connect the equation and the following statement. 

### 公式太长

If the equation cannot be written on one line with the equation marker, please insert a line break before the appropriate plus or minus sign and ensure that the left side of all lines starting from the second line does not extend beyond the leftmost side of the first line. 

### 公式序号越界

The serial numbers of the equations between lines should not go beyond the right boundary. 

### 公式是截图或公式排版不规范

Please use a correct equation editor to edit the equations. 

### 分式括号未能涵盖分式内容

Please use brackets large enough to cover the fraction structure. 

### 变量未以数学形式倾斜

For symbols representing variables, they should be in mathematical italics. In other words, single-letter variables should be in italics, and variables containing multiple letters should be made in textual italics. 

### 变量直接使用英文单词

For variables consisting of multiple letters, please consider using a simple single-letter or single-Greek letter to represent, with a number in the lower right corner to distinguish if necessary. Otherwise, please make the variables in text italics (using "\textit{}" in the mathematics environments in LaTeX). 

### 行内公式排版过于突兀

The in-line equations are not properly formatted. When reading, they may be abrupt, which may affect readers' experience. 

### 行间公式下接变量解释不规范

If the variables in the equations are to be explained on the next line, the explanation should be preceded by the word "where" written at the beginning of the line without space characters and in lowercase. 

### 角标不正确

Places that require superscripts (including superscripts and subscripts) should use superscripts correctly. 

## 写作风格

### 上下级结构标题直接连接

The title of the superstructure cannot be directly connected to the title of the subordinate structure. Please add an introductory paragraph between the two. 

### 全文没有量化数据

There are no quantitative data throughout the paper, which is not acceptable in academic papers. Please use adequate quantitative data to support the findings. 

### 全文量化数据太少

Please provide more quantitative data. 

### 关键词声明不正确

The "Key words" should be written as "keywords". There should be no space characters between the "Keywords" and the colon after it. 

### 关键词大小写不匹配

The keywords are not typeset uniformly. While keeping the professional writing of the academic terms, please capitalize the first letter of each keyword, or capitalize the first letter of the first word and all the content words of each keyword. 

### 关键词数量太多

Too many keywords are provided. Please reduce the number of keywords. 

### 引言写得不好

The Introduction section is not well-written. The Introduction section should briefly contain the related background, the limitations of the current existing (state-of-the-art) methods, research motivation, proposed methodologies, research contributions, and the paper's structure statements. 

### 引言结尾未列举贡献点或未提供剩余文章结构

Please list the contributions and subsequently provide the structure statements for the remaining sections at the end of the Introduction section. 

### 摘要结尾处无具体数据

The Abstract lacks quantitative results. Key findings should be presented in the form of quantitative outcomes to strengthen their impact at the end of the Abstract. 

### 文章存在枚举

There are many enumerations in this paper, which makes the paper not sound academic. Please reduce the usage of enumerations. 

### 无学术写作结构

This paper does not follow the academic writing standards. Please use sections and subsections with clear hierarchical sequence numbers in their titles to structure this paper. 

### 未添加伦理审查

Please add ethical consideration statements, as this paper involves data from human bodies. 

### 机翻味重

The English is not well-written. Some English expressions read like results of machine translation. 

### 章节标题没有序号

There should be an order number at the beginning of each section and subsection title. 

### 结论太长

The Conclusion section is a little long and includes subsections. Normally, there should be no subsections in the Conclusion section. Please consider creating a subsection entitled Summary in the Results and Discussion section, moving the content of the current Conclusion section to the Summary subsection, and inserting a new Conclusion section after the Results and Discussion section with brief paragraphs concluding the whole work and presenting possible future research directions. 

### 结论局限性多于优势

Writing limitations more than conclusions will make reviewers feel that the contributions are overshadowed by the shortcomings. This imbalance may create a negative final impression, suggesting that the work is defined more by what it failed to do than by what it successfully accomplished. It may further make the research appear tentative, incomplete, or lacking in confidence and forward momentum. 

### 结论没有展望

The paper should strive for objectivity. The authors should consider analyzing the limitations of this paper and proposing some possible future research directions based on those limitations at the end of the Conclusion section. 

### 综述只“综”不“述”

A review should investigate the development of a specified topic, make comparisons between different methodologies in this field, vividly describe the current state-of-the-art methods, and propose possible future research directions. 

### 缩写或简称使用不当

The abbreviations of the academic terms are not used correctly. Each academic term whose abbreviation is going to be used frequently in a section should be given its full name, followed by its abbreviation in a pair of parentheses, when it first appears in that section. Subsequently, please always use the abbreviation throughout that section. 

### 缺乏重要 Section

An academic paper should at least include, from the beginning to the end, an abstract, an Introduction section, a Related Work section, a Methodology section, an Experiments section, a Results and Discussion section, a Conclusion section, some appendix sections, and a References section. For the sections between the Introduction section and the Conclusion section, there should be subsections.

Looking forward to our next cooperation. 
Best regards.

## 态度问题

### 使用了不正规的邮箱

The current emails used for academic paper submission are informal. Please try to use institute-qualified emails. If it is difficult to use institute-qualified emails, anyway, a better way would be to use Gmail, where the email address should start with an English letter, and the length of the email address should be appropriate. 

### 回复态度不认真

While I appreciate the revision made by the authors, I would like to remind the authors of the point-to-point response to the reviewers that each corresponding response should have more words than each comment for most comments. It will be more polite and better reflect the authors' serious attitude, compared with the situation where each response has fewer words than the corresponding comment for all comments. 

## 多媒体问题

### 全文没有图表

There are no figures or tables in this paper. This can lead to a direct "reject" decision. 

### 图不清晰

The figures are not clear enough. Please improve their quality and resolution. 

### 图中文字的字体与普通文本中文字的字体不一致

The font families of the text in the figures should be changed to "Times New Roman", such that they can be aligned with the font family of the plain text. 

### 图太过鲜艳

The color matching of some figures is too sharp. Please use mild colors. 

### 图是软件截图

Normally, screenshots of software are not allowed in academic writing. 

### 图标题位置不正确

A caption of a figure should be put after the figure body. 

### 图没有标题

A caption should be offered after each figure. 

### 图片和表格应当尽可能放置在首次被提及的段落下方

Figures and tables should be placed below the paragraph where they are first referenced, if possible. 

### 图片脚注格式不正确

The footnotes of the figures are not typeset well. Please directly explain the figures at the end of the captions of the figures. 

### 图表未被显式引用

The paper presents some figures and tables, but some of them are not referenced explicitly by statements in the plain text. 

### 图表标题序号和描述之间没有冒号或空格

Each figure caption consists of a figure number and a figure title. Each table caption consists of a table number and a table title. Regarding a caption of a figure or a table, there should be a colon with a space character or a period with a space character between the number of the table and the title in the caption. For example, "Fig. 1: This is a figure. " is a good caption of a figure. 

### 子图没有子标题

Regarding the figures containing subplots, for each subplot, there should be a caption below it, consisting of a marker (like (a), (b), and (c)) and a description connected by a space character. The caption of each subplot should be editable outside the subplot instead of being embedded in the subplot. The authors can retain the descriptions marked (a), (b), (c), etc. in the main captions of the figures. 

### 子图被嵌为一个大图

If a figure includes multiple subplots, please submit the source files for each subplot separately, rather than a single source file combining, concatenating, or embedding all the subplots into one large figure, to the journal. 

### 未使用三线表

Please use the three-line table format to format the tables. If comparison is involved, please make the optimal values of each comparison group in bold. 

### 表是截图

Please make the tables editable. Using screenshots as tables is not allowed. 

### 表标题位置不正确

A caption of a table should be put before the table body. 

### 表格脚注格式不正确

The footnotes of the tables are not typeset well. Please ensure that all footnotes use a consistent smaller font size compared to the table body, and that they correctly correspond to the things required to be explained. The footnotes are aligned to the left of the document or the column. Identifiers (symbols or numbers) in the footnotes are aligned with the last character of the identifier. There is a space between the identifier and the explanation of the identifier, and these spaces are also aligned. Using the ``threeparttable`` environment is a satisfying choice if LaTeX is used for formatting. Otherwise, please consider moving all the footnotes of the tables to the end of the captions. Nonetheless, this is not a good choice. 

### 表没有标题

A caption should be offered before each table. 

## 实验

### 没有提供实验环境

Please provide experimental environments. 

### 评估指标没有公式或没有打箭头

The authors use multiple evaluation metrics to evaluate and compare different methods. However, some evaluation metrics are better the higher the value, while others are better the lower the value. The authors should provide the formulas for these evaluation metrics and mark each evaluation metric with an up or down arrow accordingly to the right of it in the table header. 

## 引用问题

### 引文过时

Please cite more references published in the last 3 years. Please also make a full investigation and discuss them. 

### 文章有参考文献但未在正文显示引用

While the paper has offered a reference list at the end of the paper, they are not cited in the text. The authors should cite all the references in the text, where their in-text views and statements that need to be supported can be supported by the references cited near them. 

### 正文中三人或以上的作者书写不正确

In English academic writing, when citing a work with three or more authors, it is standard practice to use only the last name instead of the full name of the first author, followed by "et al. ". This convention applies across major citation styles, including GB/T, APA, and MLA. 

### 正文中引用记号不正确

The in-text citation markers are not used correctly. Initially, the in-text citation markers should be marked right after the patterns that require being supported by one or more references, instead of always being marked at the end of the sentence. For example, the in-text citation markers can be placed right after the authors of the references. Secondly, each in-text citation marker should be treated as an English word in typesetting. If an in-text citation marker has a word next to it on one side, there should be a space character between the word and it on that side. Thirdly, when there are three or more references with continuous numbers cited in the same place, it should start with the first number of the continuous numbers, followed by a hyphen, and followed by the last number of the continuous numbers. When there are multiple references with non-continuous numbers or two references (whether with or without continuous numbers) cited in the same place, the numbers of these references should be placed in the same square brackets and separated by a comma and space. For example, "There is evidence [1, 2, 4-8, 10, 16, 20-25, 32] proving this. " should be a correct example. 

## 排版问题

### 分号后未接小写字母

The paper uses a lot of semicolons. Since there is still disagreement on the use of semicolons in academic papers, I have no comments on the large-scale usage of semicolons. However, the authors must ensure that the semicolon is followed by the next paragraph without a paragraph break, and the first letter of the semicolon must be lowercase.

### 多段落排版不正确

The formatting of multiple paragraphs seems incorrect. There are two formats for writing multiple paragraphs. To use the indented writing style, the first paragraph is not indented, and each paragraph from the second onwards is left with three spaces at the beginning, with no blank lines between paragraphs. To use the aligned style, there is no space at the beginning of a paragraph (top-aligned), but there is a blank line between paragraphs. 

### 引号格式不统一

Some quotation marks are straight, and some are curved. Please standardize the quotation mark format. 

### 括号排版不正确

Please always remember that any bracket (including but not limited to curly brackets, square brackets, parentheses, and equations enclosed by a pair of $) should be treated as a whole and typeset as a single word in the paper. Here are some examples. Hope they can benefit. 

```
This is an orange(fruit). -> Incorrect
This is an orange(fruit) . -> Incorrect
This is an orange(fruit)  . -> Incorrect
This is an orange (fruit). -> Correct
This is an orange (fruit) . -> Incorrect
TThis is an orange (fruit)  . -> Incorrect
This is an orange  (fruit). -> Incorrect
This is an orange  (fruit) . -> Incorrect
This is an orange  (fruit)  . -> Incorrect
```

```
This is an orange(color)orange. -> Incorrect
This is an orange(color) orange. -> Incorrect
This is an orange(color)  orange. -> Incorrect
This is an orange (color)orange. -> Incorrect
This is an orange (color) orange. -> Correct
This is an orange (color)  orange. -> Incorrect
This is an orange  (color)orange. -> Incorrect
This is an orange  (color) orange. -> Incorrect
This is an orange  (color)  orange. -> Incorrect
```

### 文本出现了多个空格字符

There are two or more continuous space characters in the text. Please use one space character only. 

### 文本应使用两端对齐而非左对齐

The text should be justified (aligned to both margins) rather than left-aligned. 

### 文章字体导致文章难以阅读

The font family used in this paper seriously affects readers' reading. Please consider changing the font family. It is recommended to use "Times New Roman" as the font family. 

### 曲引号前后引号使用不正确

The paper uses curved quotation marks. However, the opening and closing quotation marks are not written correctly. Please use the correct directional quotation marks to express the opening and closing quotation marks. 

### 标点符号后面未加空格

When a non-prefix punctuation symbol, such as a period, comma, semicolon, or colon, is followed by a word or letter, there should be and only should be one space character between the punctuation symbol and the following word or letter. 

## 期刊需求

### 没有图形学摘要

As suggested by the journal, the authors need to provide a graphical abstract. 

### 没有高光

As suggested by the journal, the authors need to enumerate some highlights. The expressions of the highlights should be different from the contributions listed at the end of the Introduction section.
